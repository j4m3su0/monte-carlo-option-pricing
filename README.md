# monte-carlo-option-pricing

A collection of code created for a project where I explored how option prices depend on modelling assumptions. Starting from the classical Black–Scholes framework, the project builds Monte Carlo simulations of both geometric Brownian motion and jump–diffusion dynamics to study how structural model misspecification leads to systematic pricing errors.
